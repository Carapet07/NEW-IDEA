# Technical Documentation - AI Escape Cage Training System

## System Architecture Overview

The AI Escape Cage Training System implements a sophisticated reinforcement learning pipeline with modular components for training, testing, and model management. The architecture follows modern software engineering principles with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.

### Core Components

1. **Training Engine**: Multi-algorithm RL training with DQN, PPO, and A2C support
2. **Environment Interface**: Gymnasium-compatible escape cage environment with Unity integration
3. **Communication Layer**: Low-latency socket-based Unity-Python bridge
4. **Model Management**: Comprehensive model lifecycle management with metadata tracking
5. **Analytics Engine**: Performance analysis, visualization, and statistical reporting
6. **Testing Framework**: Automated testing, validation, and benchmarking tools
