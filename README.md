# NEW-IDEA

### First thoughts 
08.07.2025
When lying down on the bed an interesting idea came into my mind. 
In this project I will make a self-learning-model that is going to figure out how to play with a tiny little game character. The core concept is that the character is locked up in a small 
cage surrounded by walls and other obstacles. He has some objects in his disposal which he can use to escape the cell.
So the model will have to figure out how to escape the cell using those objects.

I think I will make the game in Unity and somehow integrate the model in it, so the model will be able to control the caracter. When I figure out the nuances I will come back and write them down
